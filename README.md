Ukraine-Russia War Twitter Sentiment Analysis Using Python
This project analyzes public sentiment on Twitter related to the Ukraine-Russia war using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The project includes data cleaning, sentiment analysis, and visualizations to understand the distribution of positive, negative, and neutral sentiments in the tweets.The project incorporates sophisticated data preprocessing, such as cleaning tweets by removing links, stopwords, and punctuation, followed by stemming to normalize the text. Key visualizations, like word clouds for each sentiment, help to showcase frequent words used in both positive and negative tweets. The project‚Äôs workflow includes handling imbalanced datasets, leveraging NLP libraries for sentiment extraction, and visualizing tweet distributions across languages and sentiments. While not using supervised learning models like SVM or neural networks, this project employs sentiment scoring and is scalable to machine learning applications such as text classification or clustering for more nuanced analysis of public opinion.

Project Overview
With the increasing use of social media platforms like Twitter for expressing opinions, this project seeks to analyze the general sentiment of users tweeting about the Ukraine-Russia conflict. We use the VADER sentiment analysis tool from the NLTK library to classify tweets as Positive, Negative, or Neutral, and also generate word clouds to visualize the most common words used in these tweets.

Features
.Clean and preprocess tweet data
.Perform sentiment analysis using VADER
.Visualize the most frequent words for each sentiment category (positive, negative, neutral)
.Generate word clouds for the entire dataset as well as by sentiment type

üóÇ Dataset
The dataset contains the following columns:

.username: The name of the user who tweeted.
.tweet: The actual text of the tweet.
.language: The language in which the tweet is written.
This data will be cleaned and processed to only include relevant information before sentiment analysis.

Data Preprocessing
To prepare the data for analysis, the following preprocessing steps are performed:

.Convert text to lowercase.
.Remove links, punctuation, and special characters.
.Remove stopwords (common words that do not contribute to sentiment).
.Stem the words to their base forms.

üõ†Ô∏è Libraries Used
The following libraries were used in this project:

.Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
.Seaborn & Matplotlib: For creating visualizations and plots.
.NLTK: For text preprocessing, stopwords removal, and sentiment analysis.
.WordCloud: For generating word clouds of the most frequently used words.

To install these libraries, run:
Copy code
pip install pandas seaborn matplotlib nltk wordcloud

üìä Steps Involved
1. Data Cleaning
.Removed links, punctuation, special characters, and language errors from the tweets.
.Processed tweets by removing stopwords and applying stemming to reduce words to their base forms.

def clean(text):
    # Example of cleaning steps applied to the text
    text = str(text).lower()
    text = re.sub('https?://\S+|www\.\S+', '', text)  # Remove URLs
    text = re.sub('[%s]' % re.escape(string.punctuation), '', text)  # Remove punctuation
    # Additional cleaning steps...
    return text
data["tweet"] = data["tweet"].apply(clean)

2. Language Analysis
.Analyzed how many tweets were posted in each language:

print(data["language"].value_counts())

3. Word Cloud Visualization
.Visualized the most common words in the cleaned dataset using a word cloud.

wordcloud = WordCloud(stopwords=stopwords, background_color="white").generate(text)
plt.imshow(wordcloud, interpolation='bilinear')
plt.axis("off")
plt.show()

5. Sentiment Analysis
.Used the VADER SentimentIntensityAnalyzer to classify the tweets into Positive, Negative, and Neutral sentiments.

sentiments = SentimentIntensityAnalyzer()
data["Positive"] = [sentiments.polarity_scores(i)["pos"] for i in data["tweet"]]
data["Negative"] = [sentiments.polarity_scores(i)["neg"] for i in data["tweet"]]
data["Neutral"] = [sentiments.polarity_scores(i)["neu"] for i in data["tweet"]]

5. Positive and Negative Sentiment Word Clouds
.Positive Sentiment Word Cloud: Displayed the most frequently used words in positive tweets.
.Negative Sentiment Word Cloud: Displayed the most frequently used words in negative tweets.

üìà Visualizations
1. Overall Word Cloud
2. Positive Sentiment Word Cloud
3. Negative Sentiment Word Cloud

üß† Sentiment Analysis Results
.Most of the tweets are in English, with significant variations in sentiment across the dataset.
.Visualizing the positive and negative words provides insights into the feelings of users regarding the Ukraine-Russia conflict.


üìå Conclusion
This project helps in understanding how social media reflects the public's view of global events, such as the Ukraine-Russia war. The analysis can provide valuable insights into how different segments of society react to such events on a large scale, using sentiment as a metric.
